# Authentication Issues Investigation & Fix Plan

## Problem Analysis
Users are experiencing login issues on the website deployed on Render and Vercel. Based on the codebase examination, I've identified several critical issues that could be causing authentication failures.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Database Schema Conflicts
- **Issue**: The migration file `migration_add_password_auth.sql` has conflicting policies
- **Problem**: New RLS policies are too permissive (all users can view all profiles/uploads)
- **Impact**: Security vulnerability and potential authentication bypass

### 2. Authentication Service Configuration Issues
- **Issue**: AuthService falls back to development mode when Supabase connection fails
- **Problem**: Production deployments may be using mock authentication instead of real Supabase auth
- **Impact**: Users can't login with real credentials

### 3. Token Verification Problems
- **Issue**: Development token format conflicts with production tokens
- **Problem**: Token verification logic may not handle production tokens correctly
- **Impact**: Valid tokens may be rejected

### 4. Database Migration State
- **Issue**: Schema changes are not applied (migration file exists but may not be executed)
- **Problem**: Users table may not have required password fields
- **Impact**: Authentication queries may fail

## Todo Items

### Phase 1: Database Schema Investigation
- [ ] Check current database state and applied migrations
- [ ] Verify users table structure and required fields
- [ ] Review RLS policies for security issues
- [ ] Test database connectivity from production environment

### Phase 2: Authentication Service Analysis
- [ ] Verify Srpabase connection configuration in production
- [ ] Check environment variable configuration on Render
- [ ] Test token generation and verification flow
- [ ] Validate development vs production mode detection

### Phase 3: Frontend-Backend Communication
- [ ] Verify API endpoint connectivity between Vercel frontend and Render backend
- [ ] Check CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- [ ] Validate token storage and retrieval in frontend
- [ ] Test login request flow end-to-end

### Phase 4: Specific Fixes
- [ ] Fix RLS policies to be secure but functional
- [ ] Ensure proper Supabase configuration in production
- [ ] Fix token verification logic for production tokens
- [ ] Apply database migration if needed
- [ ] Update environment detection logic

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test login with real user credentials
- [ ] Verify token persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] Test authenticated API calls after login
- [ ] Validate security of authentication flow

## Next Steps
Before proceeding with fixes, I need to:

1. **Confirm the current database state** - Check if migration has been applied
2. **Verify production environment configuration** - Ensure Supabase credentials are properly set
3. **Test the actual authentication flow** - Identify where exactly it's failing
